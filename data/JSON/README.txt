This JSON file are available in order to change the data given in certain part of the website, especially
the repeated part of the website like footer or header.

HOW TO USE IT ?

All the JSON files have the name of the part where they used. Example, the JSON file named "footer" is used
in the footer only.
If you want to create another JSON file to do the same thing as the footer, give it the name of part concerned
and take the code in the JS file in order to adjust the parameter and avoid to make another one.

WHY USE THIS ?

This website doesn't have back-end. All the information are directly integrated on the different HTML pages because
when you use Github to publish your website, this last doesn't allow you to make a back-end part and that's normal in 
a certain way.
Anyway, this solution has been used during the development in order to avoid the changement on each page if the
data change (example, the current project that you do, etc...)
